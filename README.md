This is the GitHub repository of the XML/EpiDoc files of the 38 epigraphs of the permanent exhibition “Voices of Stone”, set up along the east side of the Museo civico Castello Ursino in Catania/Civic Museum Castello Ursino. 
The 38 inscriptions can be used on the web platform EpiCUM (http://epicum.istc.cnr.it) through a reproduction of the multimedia kiosk located in the exhibition (http://epicum.istc.cnr.it/EPICUM/chiosco/main.html).
The multimedia kiosk virtually allows to visit the exhibition "Voices of Stone ", to move around the rooms of the Museum and to examine or download each of the 38 XML/EpiDoc files.
